# Weather-webapp
Getting familiar with using API's, by making weather displaying webapp.

A web dev should know how to deal and handle API's. Therefore to learn more about them and see how one can extract data from them,
I made this webapp which takes data from the API and showcases live weather in your area.
Just allow the location access and it will detect the location itself.
